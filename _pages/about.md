I am a first year Masters student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Nicholas Harvey](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nickhar/). My research interests include convex optimization, randomized algorithms, and machine learning theory, where I've enjoyed using tools from probability theory, convex analysis, and other areas of mathematics.

I completed my Bachelors degree at UBC as well, with a combined major in mathematics and computer science. During my final year, I had the privilege to be introduced to the wrold of research in TCS by [Hu Fu](http://www.fuhuthu.com/). We worked on efficient algorithms for computing pure Nash equilibria with good social welfare in simultaneous second price auctions.
