Hello! I am a first year Masters student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Nicholas Harvey](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nickhar/). My research interests include convex optimization, randomized algorithms, and machine learning theory, where I've enjoyed using tools from probability theory, convex analysis, and other areas of mathematics.

I completed my Bachelors degree with a combined major in mathematics and computer science at UBC in 2018. During my final year, I had the privilege to be introduced to the world of research in TCS by [Hu Fu](http://www.fuhuthu.com/). We worked on efficient algorithms for computing pure Nash equilibria with good social welfare in simultaneous second price auctions. 

When I'm not doing research, I direct most of my attention to my hobbies: Weightlifting, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), and wrestling. I love these activities for the same reason I love research. There is so much to learn! Every time that I lift or train BJJ or wrestle, I learn something new to improve my skills. This is precisely the way I feel doing research. I am currently an active local competitor in BJJ.
