I am a first year Masters student at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Nicholas Harvey](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nickhar/). My research interests include convex optimization, randomized algorithms, and machine learning theory, where I enjoy using tools from probability theory, convex analysis, and other areas of mathematics.

I completed my Bachelors degree at UBC as well, with a combined major in mathematics and computer science. During my final year, I had the privilege to be advised by [Hu Fu](http://www.fuhuthu.com/).
