In March 2019, my BJJ coach (Max Nakamura) promoted me to blue belt. I've been training BJJ for about 1.5 years up to this point. Check out the gym I train at: Gracie Barra Kitsilano ([website](https://gbkitsilano.com/), [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gbkitsilano/)). 

I try to compete as much as I can find time for. Here are some results from tournaments I've medalled in:

- Gracie Barra Compnet November 2018: Bronze, White Belt, 168 lbs
- Vancouver Island Open June 2018: Bronze, White Belt, 168 lbs
- Vancouver Island Open June 2018: Silver, Beginner No-Gi, 168 lbs
- Vancouver Island Open June 2018: Bronze, Beginner No-Gi, Open weight
