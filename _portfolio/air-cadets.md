During my time in Air Cadets, I had the opportunity to learn many things. I was a member of the squadron marching band as the lead snare drummer and eventually became the drum major. I also had a chance to earn a glider pilot license and a private pilot license in the summers of 2010 and 2011 repsectively. In my final year and a half, I was promoted to squadron commander where I got to oversee the training of about ~120 cadets. The cadet program definitely helped shape who I am today!
