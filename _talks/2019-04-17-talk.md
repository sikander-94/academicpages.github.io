A talk I gave at the [Bellairs Workshop on Discrete Optimization](http://bshepherd.ca/Some_Files/Bellairs%20Workshop%202019.html) outlining the main results from our paper [Tight analyses for non-smooth stochastic gradient descent](https://sikander-randhawa.github.io/publication/2018-12-13-sgd). 

You can download the slides [here](http://sikander-randhawa.github.io/files/SGD-barbados-talk.pptx).
