A talk I gave at the Conference of Learning Theory (COLT'19) outlining the main results from our paper [Tight analyses of non-smooth stochastic gradient descent](https://sikander-randhawa.github.io/publication/2018-12-13-sgd). Our poster presentation is available [here](http://sikander-randhawa.github.io/files/colt-sgd-poster.pdf).
